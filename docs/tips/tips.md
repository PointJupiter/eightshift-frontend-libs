# Useful Tips

You have the option to add [two types of components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) in React.

1. Functional component - if you are not using any state. This component only uses props to output the data.
2. Class component - if you are using state inside your component. Then you can extend the native React component in your class and use state inside. Generally used if you have API data fetching.
