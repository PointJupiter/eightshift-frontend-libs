# Featured Categories Posts Block

Block used to provide featured posts functionality. You can simply copy/paste this block to your project and rename parts of it to fit your project (text domain mostly).

## Dependencies

None

## Implementation

1. Copy/Paste block folder in your project.
2. Add features you are going to use.
3. Rename the block name and file names to you new block.
4. Provide block details.

## Note

This block doesn't provide any specific functionality because it is only a boilerplate for your new block.
Block options don't work in Storybook as they require WP REST API data context
